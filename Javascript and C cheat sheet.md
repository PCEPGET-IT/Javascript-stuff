Hi everyone! This is the definitive cheat sheet that will cover everything we did in the last two weeks of coding lessons and hopefully make javascript easier to understand.

## Variables
Variables store information so that you can use information without typing it over and over. Variables also can change throughout your program.

So there are several different types of variables in C and Javascript
* Integer, which is negative and positive numbers without decimals
* Float, which is a decimal number
* Double, which is a decimal number like a float, but it has more decimal places
* Character(C language specific), is just one byte, probably just a letter. You don't really need words for Robots
* String(Most other languages have this), is a bunch of words and it's called a string because it's a *string* of characters. (hilarious) 

For Javascript, all you have to do to declare a variable is to type "**var**" and the name of the variable. Note that the variable name can't start with a number, but you can put a number in the name somewhere else.

Quick Examples for javascript:
```javascript
// Integer
var distance = 100

// Decimal
var money = 292.38

// String
var newstring = "I am a string!"
```

For C, you have to tell the computer what kind of variable you're declaring. 

* **int** for integer
* **float** for float
* **double** for double
* **char** for character

## if statements
```javascript 
if(condition is true){
  put code here
} 
```
